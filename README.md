# UTC2-GigDAO (DAO-based Cooperative for Gig Workers)

Welcome to your new AlgoKit project!

This is your workspace root. A `workspace` in AlgoKit is an orchestrated collection of standalone projects (backends, smart contracts, frontend apps and etc).

By default, `projects_root_path` parameter is set to `projects`. Which instructs AlgoKit CLI to create a new directory under `projects` directory when new project is instantiated via `algokit init` at the root of the workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started refer to `README.md` files in respective sub-projects in the `projects` directory.

To learn more about algokit, visit [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md).

### GitHub Codespaces

To get started execute:

1. `algokit generate devcontainer` - invoking this command from the root of this repository will create a `devcontainer.json` file with all the configuration needed to run this project in a GitHub codespace. [Run the repository inside a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.
2. `algokit init` - invoke this command inside a github codespace to launch an interactive wizard to guide you through the process of creating a new AlgoKit project

## Main Functions of UTC2-GigDAO

1. **DAO Management**: The project allows users to create and manage Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where decisions are made through member voting.

2. **Voting and Decision Making**: Users can participate in votes to decide on important DAO matters, such as budget allocations, rule changes, or new project selections.

3. **Asset Management**: The project provides asset management functions for the DAO, enabling users to track and manage the digital assets owned by the organization.

4. **Smart Contract Creation and Management**: Users can create and deploy smart contracts to automate processes within the DAO, including fund distribution and contract enforcement.

5. **Transactions and Payments**: The system supports transactions and payments between DAO members, facilitating financial dealings.

## Additional Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The project has an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to interact with DAO functions without needing deep technical knowledge.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: It offers reporting tools for users to monitor DAO performance, including financial metrics, member counts, and voting results.

- **Integration with Other Platforms**: The project can integrate with other blockchain platforms, expanding the interaction and usability of the DAO.

## Benefits for Users

- **Enhanced Transparency**: All decisions and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

- **High Participation**: Users can easily engage in DAO decisions, creating a more democratic environment.

- **Process Optimization**: The use of smart contracts helps automate many processes, minimizing errors and saving time.
